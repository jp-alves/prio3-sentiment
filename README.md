## 1 | Introduction
Brazil’s independent oil producer PetroRio S.A. (ticker PRIO3) moved from penny-stock to Ibovespa heavyweight in less than a decade.
During that climb its newsflow exploded—earnings beats, field acquisitions, OPEC shocks, regulatory twists.
**Can the tone of those headlines help explain (or even predict) the stock’s price action?**

* Scrape Portuguese headlines (2015-2024)  
* Score tone with **FinBERT-PT-BR** → `compound ∈ {-0.5, 0, +0.5}`  
* Build daily features: `compound_mean`, `compound_mag`, `art_count`  
* Join to B3 prices and compute forward returns out to **+90 days**  
* Analyse with event‐study curves, horizon bar-plots, violin distributions, correlation matrices, Granger causality and mean-difference tests.

## 2 | Main take-aways

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Intraday impact negligible** | Median `pct_d0` ≈ 0 % for all sentiment classes. |
| **Medium-term drift appears** | Neutral & Positive days beat Negative by 15–30 pp at D + 15 / 30. |
| **Statistical power weak so far** | Welch-t / Mann-Whitney on ≤ 7-day horizons not significant (p > 0.05). |
| **`compound_mean` ≈ `compound_mag`** | Pearson ρ ≈ 0.94. |
| **Sentiment–return link non-linear & lagged** | Pearson/Spearman ≈ 0 in short run; effect shows only after 5 + days. |

> **Bottom line:** headline tone doesn’t move PRIO3 intraday, yet there is early evidence of bullish drift 5–30 days after non-negative headlines—worth deeper back-testing with more data.
